A Djatoka TileSource for Seadragon

Based in spirit from the JS component of
https://github.com/ksclarke/freelib-djatoka

Instead of "synthesizing" the info for DZI, we create the path to access
Djatoka directly, and obtain different regions for the tiles.

-- Reverse proxy config --
We make the assumption that we (reverse) proxy Djatoka, to fix the same-origin
issue.

For Apache, with Drupal running on the same box as Apache, a couple lines like:

ProxyPass /adore-djatoka/ http://localhost:8080/adore-djatoka/
ProxyPassReverse /adora-djatoka/ http://localhost:8080/adore-djatoka/

in the Apache config somewhere (either the main apache.conf, httpd.conf, or in
and arbitrarily named *.conf in your Apache's conf.d directory should suffice 
to establish the reverse proxy.

-- Seadragon JS --
We assume the core Seadragon Javascript is put into sites/all/libraries/seadragon. (Much the same as Drupal deepzoom module)  It can be obtained from 
https://github.com/aseemk/seadragon-ajax/zipball/v0.8.9
