A Djatoka TileSource for Seadragon

Based in spirit from the JS component of
https://github.com/ksclarke/freelib-djatoka

Instead of "synthesizing" the info for DZI, we create the path to access
Djatoka directly, and obtain different regions for the tiles.

-- Reverse proxy config --
We make the assumption that we (reverse) proxy Djatoka, to fix the same-origin
issue.

For Apache, with Drupal running on the same box as Apache, a couple lines like:

ProxyPass /adore-djatoka/ http://localhost:8080/adore-djatoka/
ProxyPassReverse /adora-djatoka/ http://localhost:8080/adore-djatoka/

in the Apache config somewhere (either the main apache.conf, httpd.conf, or in
and arbitrarily named *.conf in your Apache's conf.d directory should suffice 
to establish the reverse proxy.

-- OpenSeadragon --
We assume the core OpenSeadragon Javascript is put into sites/all/libraries/openseadragon. It can be obtained from 
https://github.com/thatcher/openseadragon/tarball/master

TODO:

High

- provide check for OpenSeadragon in libraries in install hook.
- use libraries function to include openseadragon.
- clean up preprocess function
- provide removal of variables in uninstall hook
- availablity for multiple url's through array (newspapers)
- check for DZI, djatoka as fallback
